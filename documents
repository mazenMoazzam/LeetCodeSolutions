- Sliding Window Technique:
  This technique is ued to reduce nested loop techniques to linear time operations. Keys to this technique is keeping a subset or window of the data, expand or shrink the 
  window based on a condition, and slide the window across the input. Optimization technique when you are looking for a subset of consective elements. Instead of 
  recalculating everytime for example, which is inefficient, and is a nested approach, we use a "slide" as a window across the input and reuse previous computations.


Space Complexity:
  How much extra memory an algorithm uses as the input size for the function grows. Helps us understand if an algorithm scales efficiently with growth. 

Dynamic Programming:

- Method used to solve complex problems by breaking them down to smaller subproblems, solving each sub-problem once and storing the results for future use (memmoization)
  The key idea is to avoid repeating the work you are doing by remembering what you have solved.
