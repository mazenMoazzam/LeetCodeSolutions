- Sliding Window Technique:
  This technique is ued to reduce nested loop techniques to linear time operations. Keys to this technique is keeping a subset or window of the data, expand or shrink the 
  window based on a condition, and slide the window across the input.


Space Complexity:
  How much extra memory an algorithm uses as the input size for the function grows. Helps us understand if an algorithm scales efficiently with growth.
